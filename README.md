# Bookstore Backend

This repository contains the code for the backend of a Bookstore App. The backend is responsible for handling book data and providing the necessary APIs. It follows a folder structure that includes controllers, entities, middleware, schema, services, utils, app.ts, and route.ts files.

## Folder Structure

- **controllers**: Contains the controller files responsible for handling the request and response logic.
- **entities**: Contains the entity files representing the database models for book data.
- **middleware**: Holds middleware files used for handling request preprocessing.
- **schema**: Includes schema files defining the structure and validation rules for book data.
- **services**: Contains the service files responsible for implementing the business logic.
- **utils**: Holds utility files used throughout the backend codebase.
- **app.ts**: Entry point of the backend application, responsible for server setup and middleware configuration.
- **route.ts**: Defines the API routes and maps them to the appropriate controller functions.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm start`
